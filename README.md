# calibre2klayout

A single-script repo for a script to turn a calibre layer file to a KLayout .lyp file

The script was originally created by Nick van Beurden from NXP Semiconductors. 
It's a Perl script that converts Calibre color map files to KLayout layer properties files.

Here is how to run it:

   perl calibre2klayout.pl -input calibrelayerfile.txt -verbose
